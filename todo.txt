Minutes:

- Two edit columns, override (or add in missing data) and synced (could override room, name)
- Default values?
- Help information/contact information?
- 'Sync' should offer/highlight possible updates
- Override values should be stored in a separate table
- 'Data being used' table, as well as a 'last pulled' table
- Only get Face models where 'visible' is true - some can be false (checkbox or something)

For next week:
- Have the web application output JSON for Nick
- As above
